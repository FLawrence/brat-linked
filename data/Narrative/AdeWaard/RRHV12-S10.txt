Red Riding Hood Variation 12
Red Riding Hood takes a basket of food to his Grandpa, but Grandpa's house is outside the village, so he has to walk through the woods to get there.

A hungry wolf finds out where he's going, and decides to ambush him by going to Grandpa's cottage, swallowing Grandpa whole, putting on Grandpa's clothes, and waiting in Grandpa's bed.

Red Riding Hood arrives and notices Grandpa looks odd. "My, what big eyes you have, Grandpa!"

"All the better to see you with," said the wolf, smiling.

"And what strong arms you have," he said, nervously.

"All the better to hug you with," said the wolf, holding Red Hood still.

"And what very big teeth you have!" he yelled, starting to struggle.

"All the better to eat you with!" snarled the wolf, and gobbled him up!

And then the well-fed wolf curls up in Grandpa's bed and falls asleep.

But a woodcutter comes, sees the wolf, and cuts the wolf's belly open with his axe. Red Riding Hood and Grandpa fall out, still alive, and are rescued.

The wolf tries to run away, but he dies.
