Red Riding Hood Variation 18
A girl wearing a red hooded cloak has been shopping for food for her family. Her parents and brothers and sisters are out at work but her grandmother is at home waiting for her. On the way home through the woods the girl meets a wolf who tries to tempt her to stray from the path or give him her basket. When she refuses he lopes off through the wood and reaches her house ahead of her. Finding the grandmother alone, he eats her. When the girl comes in the wolf tries to convince her that he is the grandmother but the girl asks many questions. Just as it seems the wolf might succeed, and eat the girl, a woodcutter who is passing rushes in and kills the wolf, and rescues the grandmother from his stomach.
