Rad Riding Hood Variation 21
A young boy wearing a red hooded cloak set out to visit his grandfather, taking a basket of cakes as a gift. On the way through the woods a wolf tried to tempt him to leave the path or hand over the basket for her hungry cubs but the boy refused and continued on his way, not knowing that the wolf, using tracks through the undergrowth, would reach the grandfather’s cottage ahead of him and eat the old man. When the boy reached the cottage the wolf tried hard to persuade him that he was the grandfather, having donned the grandfather’s clothes. The boy argued and was suspicious but it seemed he was about to be convinced. However, a passing woodcutter came into the cottage and killed the wolf, whereupon the boy was reunited with his grandfather, who stepped out of the wolf’s stomach safe and well.
