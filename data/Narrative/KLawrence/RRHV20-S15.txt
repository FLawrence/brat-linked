Red Riding Hood Variation 15
The Redhood Bank was a new institution, making its way cautiously through financial minefields with guidance from an older bank, the Grandparent Savings Bank (GSB). One day, Wolf&Co tried to tempt Redhood to ignore all rules and regulations, and to invest money in illegal schemes. There was, of course, a promise of vast profits. Redhood was, as already stated, cautious, and refused, but decided to consult GSB about the invitation, wondering whether it ought to be reported to any governing body. Redhood was shocked to find the GSB had already been swallowed by Wolf&Co who did not even admit to the takeover but tried to get Redhood to join their nefarious plans by lying about both GSB and the general purpose of their own investments. Redhood reported their actions on a government hotline but nothing happened and for a while it seemed likely that Wolf&Co would take over Redhood, whose capital was quite small, and who needed other investors to survive. Then at the last minute a government agent stepped in and closed down Wolf&Co, In the ensuing dismantling of their affairs, GSB was released to function again as a legitimate bank and of course as a mentor of Redhood.
