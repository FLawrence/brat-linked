Red Riding Hood Variation 62
A young girl called Little Red Riding Hood lives by the forest. Her mother asks her to deliver a basket of fruit and treats to her ill grandmother in the forest. En route, Red thinks about leaving the path to explore, but as her mother had previously warned her not to do this, Red Riding Hood stays on the path. She's good like that.

When Red Riding Hood arrives, her grandma is sick in bed, but pleased to see her granddaughter. She accepts the basket of treats, and the two have a nice old chat. A passing woodsman wanders by along the path, and notices nothing unusual.

After a delightful visit to her grandmother, Red turns home safe and sound. It was a pretty dull day, but on the plus side no one got killed and everyone lived happily ever after.
