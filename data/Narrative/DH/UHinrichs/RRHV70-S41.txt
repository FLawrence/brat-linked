Red Riding Hood Variation 70
Little Red Riding Hood's mother asks her to deliver a basket to her grandmother and warned her about interacting with strangers. She does not heed that warning and talks to a wolf. The wolf beats Hood to it and reaches the grandmother's house, overpowers her, locks her in a cupboard, and waits for Hood, in the disguise of a grandmother. When Hood reaches, she quizzes the wolf about her appearance they have a conversation regarding the various aspects of the same. At the end of the conversation, the wolf ditches the disguise and attacks Hood. Hood screams for help but no one is around nearby. Hood tries to fend off the wolf by herself but starts to quickly lose ground in the fight. Meanwhile, the grandmother unlocks herself and is joined by Hood's mother, who came by since she was concerned about her daughter's safety. Together, the three of them overpower the wolf, and beat him up. Hood learns her lesson and never talks to strangers again.
