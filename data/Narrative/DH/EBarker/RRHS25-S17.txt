Red Riding Hood 25
Little Red Riding Hood was a little girl who always wore a bright red cloak and hood. One day, Red took a basket of goodies to her grandmother, who was sick. Grandmother lived in the woods, and Red's mother told her to keep to the path and watch out for wolves.

As Red set off she met a wolf, who asked where she was going. She told him politely that she was visiting her sick grandmother. The wolf wished her well and went on his way. But he ran secretly to Grandmother's house, where he knocked on the door and mimicked Red's voice. When Grandmother opened the door, the wolf gobbled her up. Then he put on her cap and apron and got into her bed to wait.

Soon Red arrived and knocked on the door. "Come in dear," said the wolf in Grandmother's voice. But Red stood in the doorway, afraid.

"Why Grandmother," she said, "what big eyes you have!"

"All the better to see you with," answered the wolf.

"Why Grandmother," said Red, "what big ears you have!"

"All the better to hear you with," answered the wolf.

"Why Grandmother," said Red very nervously, "what big teeth you have!"

"All the better to GOBBLE YOU UP!" cried the wolf, and he did just that. Then he curled up in the bed and fell asleep.

A woodcutter was passing and heard the wolf's loud snoring. "That poor old lady doesn't sound very well," he thought, "I had better check that she's all right."

The woodcutter went in and saw the wolf, with its huge belly. Quickly, he took his axe and cut the wolf open. Out sprang Red and her grandmother, none the worse. They were very grateful to the woodcutter for saving them, and invited him to tea.
