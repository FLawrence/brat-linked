Red Riding Hood 11
Red Riding Hood takes a basket of food to her Grandma, but Grandma's house is outside the village, so she has to walk through the woods to get there.

A hungry wolf finds out where she's going, and decides to ambush her by going to Grandma's cottage, swallowing Grandma whole, putting on Grandma's clothes, and waiting in Grandma's bed.

Red Riding Hood arrives and notices Grandma looks odd. "My, what big eyes you have, Grandma!"

"All the better to see you with," said the wolf, smiling.

"And what strong arms you have," she said, nervously.

"All the better to hug you with," said the wolf, holding Red Hood still.

"And what very big teeth you have!" she yelled, starting to struggle.

"All the better to eat you with!" snarled the wolf, and gobbled her up!

And then the well-fed wolf curls up in Grandma's bed and falls asleep.

But a woodcutter comes, sees the wolf, and cuts the wolf's belly open with his axe. Red Riding Hood and Grandma fall out, still alive, and are rescued.

The wolf tries to run away, but he dies.
