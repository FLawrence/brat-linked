Red Riding Hood Variation 71
Little Red Riding Hood's mother asks him to deliver a basket to her grandmother and warned her about interacting with strangers. He does not heed that warning and talks to a wolf. The wolf beats Hood to it and reaches the grandmother's house, overpowers her and waits for Hood, in the disguise of a grandmother. When Hood reaches, he quizzes the wolf about her appearance they have a conversation regarding the various aspects of the same. At the end of the conversation, the wolf ditches the disguise and attacks Hood. Hood screams for help and some woodcutters nearby rescue him and his grandmother and beat up the wolf. The wolf went away forever; and Hood learnt his lesson and never again spoke to strangers.
