Red Riding Hood 61
A young girl called Little Red Riding Hood lives by the forest. Her mother asks her to deliver a basket of fruit and treats to her ill grandmother in the forest. En route, a wolf tries to tempt her off the path, but as her mother had previously warned her not to do this, Red Riding Hood stays on the path.

Meanwhile, the wolf races on ahead. It breaks and enters its way into grandma's house, and eats her up. It gets into bed, pretending to be grandma.

When Red Riding Hood arrives, she doesn't recognise the wolf. They have a short conversation in which she exclaims over what big eyes and a mouth it has â€“ at which point it cries "all the better to eat you with!" and gobbles her up.

Luckily, a passing woodsman hears Red Riding Hood's scream, and comes in in time to rescue Red Riding Hood and her Grandma from the wolf's belly. The wolf is killed, and everyone else lives happily ever after.
