Red Riding Hood 68
Little Red Riding Hood's mother asks her to deliver a basket to her grandmother and warned her about interacting with strangers. She does not heed that warning and talks to a wolf. The wolf beats Hood to it and reaches the grandmother's house, overpowers her and waits for Hood, in the disguise of a grandmother. When Hood reaches, she quizzes the wolf about her appearance they have a conversation regarding the various aspects of the same. At the end of the conversation, the wolf ditches the disguise and attacks Hood. Hood screams for help and some woodcutters nearby rescue her and her grandmother and beat up the wolf. The wolf went away forever; and Hood learnt her lesson and never again spoke to strangers.
