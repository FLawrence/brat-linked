Red Riding Hood 45
A young girl is warned of the dangers inherent in fraternising with strangers. Wearing her favourite red cloak, she sets out to visit her grandmother. En route, she is approached by a wolf who befriends her and finds out her destination. When she reaches her grandmotherâ€™s house, the wolf has tricked his way in and awaits the young girl whilst disguised as her grandmother.

Before he can attack the girl, a lumberjack recues her and the grandmother emerges from within the wolf.

The tale is a parable for exercising caution.
