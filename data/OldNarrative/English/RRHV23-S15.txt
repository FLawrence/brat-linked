Red Riding Hood Variation 23
A young girl wearing a red cloak set out into the woods to pick flowers to lay on her grandmother’s grave. A wolf stepped into her path and tried to persuade her to follow him but she refused and continued with her task. At last she had a basket full of flowers and headed for the graveyard. Unknown to her, the wolf had reached the grave by a different route and hid behind the gravestone. He tried at first to frighten the girl by imitating her grandmother’s voice, hoping she would think the place haunted and run, and perhaps fall so that he could catch her. The girl argued bravely with what she thought could be a ghost but was beginning to lose confidence when a gravedigger who heard the commotion came rushing with his spade and killed the wolf, whereupon the girl left the flowers on the grave and went home.
