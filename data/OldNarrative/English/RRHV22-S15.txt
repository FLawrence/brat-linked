Red Riding Hood Variation 22
A young girl in a red cloak was told to visit her grandmother with a basket of cakes as a gift. On her way through the woods she hesitated. She disliked her grandmother, who frightened her and sometimes administered punishments for no reason. However, her mother had told her to go, and she continued on her journey, hoping that things would be different this time. On arriving at the cottage she soon realised that her grandmother was in an extremely argumentative mood and she wished she had turned around and gone home. The grandmother attacked her with a belt but the girlâ€™s cries were heard by a passing woodcutter who rushed into the cottage and restrained the old woman, who was later removed to a psychiatric facility and never had the opportunity to upset the girl again.
