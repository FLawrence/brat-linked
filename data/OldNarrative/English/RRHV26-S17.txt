Red Riding Hood Variation 26
Little Red Riding Hood was a little girl who always wore a bright red cloak and hood. She lived in a cottage in the woods with her mother and grandmother. Grandmother looked after Red while her mother worked.

One day, Grandmother was feeling poorly and asked Red to fetch some medicine from the village. “But keep to the path, and watch out for wolves!” she said. On the way Red met a wolf, who asked where she was going. She told him politely that she was fetching medicine for her grandmother, and the wolf wished her well and went on his way. But he ran secretly to the cottage, where he knocked on the door and mimicked Red’s voice. When Grandmother opened the door, the wolf gobbled her up. Then he put on her cap and apron and got into her bed to wait.

When Red came home, it was dark and she couldn’t see very well, but something seemed wrong.

“Why Grandmother,” she said, “what big eyes you have!”

“All the better to see you with,” answered the wolf.

“Why Grandmother,” said Red, “what big ears you have!”

“All the better to hear you with,” answered the wolf.

“Why Grandmother,” said Red very nervously, “what big teeth you have!”

“All the better to GOBBLE YOU UP!” cried the wolf, and he did just that. Then he curled up in the bed and fell asleep.

A woodcutter was passing and heard the wolf’s loud snoring. He decided to check that everything was all right.

The woodcutter went in and saw the wolf, with its huge belly. Quickly, he took his axe and cut the wolf open. Out sprang Red and her grandmother, none the worse. They were very grateful to the woodcutter for saving them, and invited him to tea.
