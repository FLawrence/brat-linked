Red Riding Hood 17
A young girl wearing a red hooded cloak sets out to visit her grandmother. She is carrying a basket of cakes as a gift. In the woods, a wolf tries to tempt her to stray from the path or give up her basket. Upon failing, he goes to the grandmother’s cottage ahead of the girl. When the girl arrives, the wolf, who has eaten the grandmother, tries to persuade the girl that he is the grandmother so that she will get close enough to be eaten. The girl is hard to persuade and asks many questions, but the wolf is crafty and it seems he will win. Before he can eat the girl a woodcutter rushes in, kills the wolf, and rescues the grandmother from the wolf’s stomach.
