Red Riding Hood 74
Little Red Ridinghood goes to take lunch for her grandmother who lives in alone in a cabin in the forest.

Along the way there she meets up with a wolf who finds out where she’s going.

The wolf gets to the grandmother’s house and convinces her to let him in - he then swallows her whole, puts on her clothes and get into her bed.

Little Red Ridinghood (LRRH)arrives and has a conversation with the wolf who she mistakes for her grandmother. They have a dialogue which involves LRRH marvelling her grandmother’s features, and the wolf having a reply on each case. At the end of the dialogue the wolf swallows LRRH whole.

At this time, a man in charge of maintaining the woods walks by, hears LRRH’s screams, comes in, kills the wolf, cuts its belly open and out tumble LRRH and her grandmother, alive and well.
