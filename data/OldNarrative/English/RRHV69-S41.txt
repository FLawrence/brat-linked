Red Riding Hood Variation 69
Little Red Riding Hood’s mother asks her to deliver a basket to her grandmother and warned her about interacting with strangers. She does not take the warning seriously, but does not meet any strangers on the way either. She reaches the grandmother’s house safely and delivers the basket to her. The grandmother thanks Hood for the same and after spending some time with her grandmother, Hood returns back home safe, unable to comprehend the reason as to why her mother gave her the warning about not speaking to strangers, and hopes she will find out someday.
