Red Riding Hood Variation 15
A girl wearing a red hooded cloak is taking cakes to her grandmother. On her way through the woods she meets a wolf who tries to tempt her to leave the path or give him her basket. When she refuses he retreats, but in fact reaches the grandmotherâ€™s cottage ahead of the girl, and eats the grandmother. When the girl arrives the wolf tries to convince her that he is the grandmother, hoping she will come close enough to eat. The girl is wary and asks questions but is eventually convinced. However, as the wolf pounces on her, she pulls a cake knife from the basket and kills him by slicing open his stomach, whereupon her grandmother steps out, shaken but unharmed.
