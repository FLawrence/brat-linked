Red Riding Hood 72
Little Red Riding Hood, the woodcutter’s daughter, was taking food to her dear old Grandma. Whilst walking through the woods, a wolf jumped out at her from the bushes. “Oh!” said Red Riding Hood.

“Where are you going?” asked the wolf.

Red Riding, unfazed by the sudden appearance of a talking wolf in her life (she was only young), told him. He asked for directions, so she told him those too. He cackled and bounded off towards Grandma’s house. Red Riding Hood shrugged and continued walking.

When she got to Grandma’s house, she knocked on the door and was invited inside. The voice that answered her was deep and growly. Red Riding Hood commented on this fact.

“All the better to greet you with,” came the reply.

Red Riding Hood entered the house and saw her Grandma, bundled up in old maid clothes, but with eyes the size of dinner plates.

“What large eyes you have!” said Red Riding Hood.

“All the better to see you with,” came the reply. “Come, give old Grandma a hug.”

Red Riding Hood obliged, and huge furry paws engulfed her.

“What large hands you have!” said Red Riding Hood.

“All the better to hold you with,” came the reply.

“You can let go now, Grandma. Any time.” said Red Riding Hood.

“How about you give old Granny a kiss first?”

“But… your teeth, they’re so big!”

“All the better to eat you with!” shouted the wolf. He swallowed Red Riding Hood whole.

And then… the world split in two.

In one world, the wolf stayed in the house for some time, burping occasionally, before sloping off somewhere.

In the other world, the woodcutter suddenly turned up and Deus Ex Machina’d Red Riding Hood and Grandma out of the wolf’s stomach with an axe.
